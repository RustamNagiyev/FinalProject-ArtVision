          <p class="partist">Dutch painter and printmaker. He is one of the most important painters in European and Dutch art history. He lived in the Dutch Golden Age, when the Netherlands made a breakthrough in trade, science and art. He is also known as the "painter of light and shadows".(15.07.1606-04.10.1669)</p>

        <h2 class="h21">The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp, 1632</h2>
        <p class="p1">This work was one of Rembrandt's earlier pieces; it was painted by the artist at the age of 25, when he had just four other portraits to his name. The piece captures seven Amsterdam surgeons in a lesson with their teacher Dr. Tulp, who is demonstrating how muscles in the arm are attached. Dynamics in the scene are created through the use of light and dark — something that would heavily feature in his art to come.

          <h2 class="h2">The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, 1633</h2>
          <p class="p">The current location of this piece remains a mystery, as the artwork was stolen in 1990 by two thieves dressed as police officers. As the title suggests, the painting is in reference to the biblical tale of Jesus calming the storm on the sea of Galilee. It was the only seascape painted by the artist, and is proof of how Rembrandt captures the drama of a moment so easily in a painting, and also his ability to immerse a spectator into the action.

          <h2 class="h2"> Danae, 1636</h2>
          <p class="p">All kinds of drama are associated with this 1636 piece, which shows Greek goddess Danae welcoming Zeus into her bed. Originally, Rembrandt used his first wife Saskia van Uylenburgh to model for the piece but it’s thought he later replaced her face with his mistress Geertje Dircx. In 1985, the painting was subject to an acid attack at the Hermitage Museum — the man also proceeded to cut the artwork twice with a knife. Fortunately it was fully restored in 1997.

          <h2 class="h2">The Night Watch, 1642</h2>
          <p class="p">Widely considered to be Rembrandt’s most famous work, The Night Watch was completed at the height of the Dutch Golden Age. The piece is famous for a variety of reasons but primarily due to its enormous 11ft by 14ft size. It’s also praised for its use of shadow and for capturing a portrait of the military in motion — as soldiers of the time would commonly stand for photos with static poses. Some critics have suggested the piece is connected to Rembrandt’s fall into poverty because it reveals a murder connected to members of the civic militia. It's thought he may have received blackmail or threats as a result of it.

          <h2 class="h2">Bathsheba at Her Bath, 1654</h2>
          <p class="p">This painting depicts the Old Testament story of King David, who saw Bathsheba bathing and fell in love with her at first sight. In the piece she holds a letter from David in her hand, while her attendant washes her feet. It’s speculated that the model used for the artwork was Rembrandt’s long-time partner Hendrickje Stoffels, and critics have praised the piece for showing the female body in a realistic way, rather than as an idolised form. This work can now be seen at the Louvre in Paris.

          <h2 class="h2">Self-Portrait with Beret and Turned Up Collar, 1659</h2>
          <p class="p">Painted in 1659, around 10 years before his death, this is one of the artist’s most famous self-portraits. It was created at a time when Rembrandt was battling to avoid bankruptcy — something critics have suggested can be seen through the looser brushstrokes in the piece. Despite the less compact brushwork, the self-portrait shows a close attention to detail, which can be seen in parts such as the cheekbones and the intricate wrinkles under the eye.

          <h2 class="h2">Syndics of the Drapers’ Guild, 1662</h2>
          <p class="p">Also known as The Sampling Officials, this artwork was one of the last group portraits painted by Rembrandt. The Guild pictured in the work commissioned Rembrandt to carry out the group portrait, despite his plummeting status and financial problems at the time. It's currently owned by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam — a museum famous for its collection of Rembrandt works, including The Night Watch.

          <h2 class="h2">The Jewish Bride, 1667</h2>
          <p class="p">The Jewish Bride painted in 1667, during the last years of Rembrandt’s life, was not the original name of the piece. It gained its current title in the 19th century, after an Amsterdam art collector suggested the people in the work represent a Jewish father giving his daughter a necklace on her wedding day. Alternative interpretations have alluded to it being of the artist’s son Titus and his bride. It’s another great example of Rembrandt capturing raw emotion in a single work.

          <h2 class="h2">Return of the Prodigal Son, 1669</h2>
          <p class="p">This piece was one of Rembrandt’s last, and refers to the famous biblical tale of the same name. It’s considered to be one of the artist’s most moving artworks due to the fact that it captures the strong bond between father and son. Many believe the father is shown to be expressing multiple emotions at the same time, including grief, mercy and love. It’s this depth of feeling in the father’s complex facial expression that particularly stands out in this work.
