          <h1 class="hartist">Michelangelo</h1>
          <p class="partist">Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni is an Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect and poet. Michelangelo was born on March 6, 1475, in Caprese, near Arezzo. His family moved to Florence when he was just a month old.(06.03.1475-18.02.1564)</p>

        <h2 class="h2">The Sistine Chapel Ceiling </h2>
        <p class="p">As soon as you hear Michelangelo artworks, the first painting that comes to mind instantly is the one on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The ceiling of this chapel in the Vatican City displays stunning fresco Michelangelo’s painting curated by Michelangelo. Pope Julius II commissioned this work, and Michelangelo developed this between 1508 and 1512. This painting is the High Renaissance’s most significant works and depicts all the nine stories featured in the Book of Genesis. Initially, Michelangelo was reluctant to take up this work. The art lovers hugely appreciated the results back then, and even now, around five million people flock here to witness this marvelous work by him.

          <h2 class="h2">The Last Judgment Painting, Sistine Chapel</h2>
          <p class="p">Another masterpiece of Michelangelo’s paintings in the Sistine Chapel is the “Last Judgment”. In this painting Michelangelo’s painting adorns the altar wall of the chapel. Michelangelo executed this painting about 25 years after the creation of the artistic fresco on the chapel’s ceiling. Often cited as the most intricate pieces made by Michelangelo, this spectacular work is a fine portrayal of the final judgment of mankind by God. This Michelangelo painting depicted nudity, and due to this, it had a very controversial past, so much so that the Council of Trent ordered to cover up the parts that seemed obscene.

          <p class="p">The Torment of Saint Anthony is one of the first works of art by Michelangelo, which he created when he was just twelve or thirteen years old. Currently, The Kimbell Art Museum in Texas houses this painting. This painting is based on an engraved art piece initially created by Martin Schongauer, who was a German printmaker and painter. The first biographers of Michelangelo, Ascanio Condivi, and Giorgio Vasari, have cited this painting in their work. This is a particularly accomplished art piece which has received tremendous appreciation worldwide, since its creation.

          <h2 class="h2">Doni Tondo</h2>
          <p class="p">Doni Tondo, which means “The Holy Family,” is the only panel painting Michelangelo painted that has survived through the years. Michelangelo created this panel painting for Agnolo Doni, who was one of the wealthiest bankers in Florence. He created it to commemorate the banker’s marriage to Maddalena, who hailed from a noble Tuscan family (Strozzi). Michelangelo curated the original frame of this panel painting, which is a wonderful ornate wooden piece. Since the year 1653, this work of the artist resides in Galleria Degli Uffizi in Florence. The iridescent hues used in this Michelangelo painting with the subjects posing unnaturally, had earlier laid the groundwork the art movement by Mannerist.

          <h2 class="h2">The Crucifixion of St. Peter</h2>
          <p class="p">The Crucifixion of St. Peter was the final fresco Michelangelo painted in his lifetime. Originally, Pope Paul III commissioned this painting in the year 1541. Currently, you can find this painting in Cappella Paolina in Vatican Palace. In contrast to the other depictions of St. Peter of the Renaissance era, Michelangelo focused on the death of this saint through this painting. 2004 saw the commencement of a five-year long restoration project worth €3.2 million. This project led to the revelation of a fascinating fact about Michelangelo depicting himself in the painting in the form of a figure clad with a blue turban in the upper left part of the painting.

          <h2 class="h21">Creation of Adam</h2>
          <p class="p1">This is a legendary painting by Michelangelo, which finds its depiction as a part of the vast masterpiece that adorns the interiors of the Sistine Chapel. This painting is one of the most innovative depictions of how the creation of Adam commenced. Contrary to the traditional works of art, in this painting, God is not displayed as regal, aloof, and way above mortal beings. The artist considered it essential to depict God intimately with the mortal man.

          <p class="p1">In the Fall of Mankind and Expulsion from Paradise Painting by Michelangelo signifies how humans must show their respect towards God and not draw influences by other distractions. The idea behind this painting is that if humans pay more attention to their possessions, they will land in several problems. Michelangelo perfectly captures the scene in this painting, which finds its roots in the Genesis, a book that encourages followers to go along the right course from God’s perspective.

          <p class="p">This painting by Michelangelo displays an iconic event in the life of Saul, who was commonly known as “Paul the Apostle.” The artist made this stunning conversion painting in the later years of his life. Unfortunately, it failed to receive the same amount of popularity that was received by the other Michelangelo’s paintings. Perhaps the reason behind it was the moderate and modest use of the mannerist approach in the painting. However, this artwork is popular now and finds its home in Cappella Paolina, located in the Vatican Palace.
