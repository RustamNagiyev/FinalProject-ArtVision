          <h1 class="hartist">Paul Gauguin</h1>
          <p class="partist">Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin, French painter. Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin is a Post-Impressionist painter, born June 7, 1848, in Paris. He settled in Peru with his family in 1851.(07.06.1848-08.05.1903)</p>

        <h2 class="h21">The Little One Is Dreaming (1881)</h2>
        <p class="p1">Depicting his daughter, Aline, asleep on a cot, Gauguin’s work ‘The Little One is Dreaming’ is an early example of his forays into symbolic painting.
            At first glance, this piece appears to be realist but there are a few features that point towards the symbolism for which Paul Gauguin is best known.Gauguin draws from his imagination to paint dreamlike representations into the composition. Above the child’s head, for instance, black birds are taking flight and a Punch toy hangs from the edge of the bed. This doll is a motif that Gauguin returned to frequently in his paintings.

          <h2 class="h2">  Landscape near Arles (1888)</h2>
          <p class="p">One of very few landscapes Gauguin painted without human figures, ‘Landscape near Arles’ was produced while he was staying in Provence.
            Rather than painting forms directly from nature, as in the work of Impressionists like Alfred Sisley, Gauguin instead simplified this landscape into a series of geometric forms.

          <h2 class="h2">Blue Trees [Your Turn Will Come, My Beauty!] (1888)</h2>
          <p class="p">During his stay with Van Gogh in Arles, Gauguin painted ‘Blue Trees’ featuring four strong vertical lines of bright blue tree trunks.
            Between the trees, there is a landscape of dazzling, dreamlike colours: a yellow sky, red clouds, a line of blue undergrowth and a bright orange path.

          <h2 class="h21"> Night Cafe, Arles (1888)</h2>
          <p class="p1">In November 1888, Gauguin co-wrote a letter with Van Gogh to send to the artist Émile Bernard.
            The letter described their experiences in the early days of living together in the Yellow House at Arles.The letter also referenced Gauguin’s painting ‘Night Cafe, Arles’:

            “Now something that will interest you – we’ve made some excursions in the brothels, and it’s likely that we’ll eventually go there often to work. ... At the moment Gauguin has a canvas in progress of the same night cafe that I also painted, but with figures seen in the brothels. It promises to become a beautiful thing.”

          <h2 class="h2"> La Vague (1888)</h2>
          <p class="p">Gauguin regularly chose to compose his landscapes using an elevated perspective, inspired by the Japanese prints that were enormously popular in France at this time.
            In ‘La Vague’ or ‘The Wave’, this effect is extreme with the viewer looking down from an almost vertical height at the coastal scene below.

          <h2 class="h2">Vision After the Sermon (1888)</h2>
          <p class="p">“I like living in Brittany; here I find a savage, primitive quality,” wrote Gauguin in February 1888.
            In this piece, we see Gauguin go some way to expressing that quality on his canvas.Gauguin had a strong desire to find a new kind of expression in painting and while in Pont-Aven in August 1888 he began to realise those aims.

          <p class="p">In a letter to Van Gogh, Gauguin described his latest painting:
            “Blue-green sky in the west, all the trees bent in a purple mass, the earth is violet and Christ is dressed in a dark ochre attire, his hair vermillion. The canvas is not intended to be understood. I shall keep it for myself for a long time.”
            
            The piece was ‘Christ in the Garden of Olives’.

          <p class="p">This self-portrait was painted shortly before Gauguin’s departure to Tahiti for the first time.
            Within the painting, we can see the artist ruminating on different parts of his personality through his own artworks.

          <h2 class="h2">The Ancestors of Tehamana (1893)</h2>
          <p class="p">In 1891, Gauguin arrived in Papeete, the capital of Tahiti.
            Tahiti was a French colony and Gauguin - like many other French expats - married a local.This was extremely controversial, on account of the fact that Gauguin's new wife - Tehamana - was only 13 years old. To make matters worse, the marriage was arranged by Gauguin's bride's family over the course of an afternoon.

            In fact there were loads of further problems: Gauguin had abandoned a wife and five children in France, and was suffering from syphilis.
