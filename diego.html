          <p class="partist">Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez is a Spanish painter. King IV. He worked as chief painter at Felipe's court. He is one of the unique painters of the Baroque period and is famous for his portraits. Due to his closeness to the Spanish King, he painted many nobles and palace life.(06.06.1599-06.08.1660)</p>

        <p class="p">Diego de Acedo is sitting outside on a stone. He is wearing a conventional dark dress with beautiful intertwined fabrics and a cap positioned sideways on his head.

             The books and the inkstand most likely allude to his role at the Spanish Court. The portrait was painted toward the end of the 1630s before the Torre de la Parada, a sixteenth-century chasing lodge that Philip had remodeled and brightened for his collection of paintings to be displayed.

          <p class="p">The elderly man is giving the young boy a glass of water.

            Both the subjects never look at one another, nor do they look at the watcher. This could be a direct result of their societal position or something as basic as their age contrast.

          <h2 class="h21">Old Woman Frying Eggs</h2>
          <p class="p1">The Old Woman Cooking Eggs shows Velázquez's aptitude in painting individuals in conventional settings and having it encompass us, as observers, to that moment in time.

            Velázquez was roughly eighteen or nineteen when he created this piece.
            
            The painting shows a senior woman sitting before an earthen pot in which she is cooking eggs. On the left side is a young boy watching her cook while holding a carafe of wine in one hand and a melon under his other arm.

          <p class="p">Christ is portrayed after his restoration. The light source in this work enters from the left and seems fixated on or close to Christ's head. The other two men seem to be having some sort of discussion. 

            Velazquez's experimentation with alternate points of view of a subject and his capacity to bring the watcher into an artwork is beautifully demonstrated in this composition.

          <p class="p">In 1648, Philip IV sent Velázquez to Rome to buy some masterpiece paintings for the Alcázar Palace in Madrid.

            Velázquez had with him Juan de Pareja, who at that time was his companion. The two men arrived in Genoa, then went to Milan to see Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, and afterward to Venice to see Tintoretto and Titian.
            
            They purchased paintings of Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese en route. During their stay in Rome, Velázquez painted this little oil portrait of Pareja, maybe in anticipation of him knowing he would paint a portrait of Pope Innocent X. And he would have to show him one of his paintings.
            
            Pareja was a skilled painter himself.
